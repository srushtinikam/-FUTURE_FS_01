# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This is a personal professional portfolio website created Me using React.js, HTML, and CSS. The main objective of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, qualifications, and achievements in a clean and professional manner.This portfolio acts as a digital resume where visitors can explore my technical skills, view my past projects, download my resume, and contact me directly through an integrated contact form.
The website is fully responsive, meaning it works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. I have used EmailJS to enable a functional contact form that sends messages directly to my email without requiring any backend server.
The portfolio includes sections like Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Each project listed features details like the project description, the technologies used, and links to both the GitHub repository and the live demo (if available).
This project helps me represent myself professionally to recruiters, clients, and anyone interested in my work. The website is deployed online using Vercel or Netlify for easy accessibility. It’s also optimized for performance and SEO to ensure good visibility on search engines.
This portfolio will be regularly updated as I gain more experience and skills.
